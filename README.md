# devbox

A simple, portable Vagrant box that can reasonably easily be set up on any environment to get a Linux-y environment going with minimal hassle.

## Usage

1. Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - you probably need at least version 5.0+ for Ubuntu 16.4 to work.
3. Install the following vagrant plugins:

  ```
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-puppet
  ```

4. `vagrant up`, and go get a coffee while things download. â˜•
